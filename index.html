I am unique, an irreplaceable human being.
The first me and the last.
I am God's creature, no one will ever replace me.

I'm not wealthy but guess what, i'm happy because God takes care of me.
You may hate me, but it makes no difference to my life because
You are not my Maker and you were not there when He creates me.

I am me, 
Irreplaceable me, 
Just me, 
And original me....

To you i'm useless, but to God and my family i'm so special.

I may not be handsome, but God is still working on that...
I may not have everything i want, but i have a loving family and friends...
I may be a fool to you, but to my family i'm a loving and caring family member.
You may think i'm selfish, but to my friends i'm a friend indeed.
You may think i'm a moron, but to my family and friends i'm intelligent.


So keep your ten cent worth thoughts and opinions to yourself.
Because i don't need them.
And give me the credit i deserve, congratulate me when its needed.
And what ever you think of me, i don't care, 
Because i won't change my lifestyle just to please YOU! 

Get used to the fact that i'm in control of my life and i'm FINE.
Know that i'm unique beacause, 
I am me, 
Irreplaceable me, 
Just me, 
And original me...

Thats who I am...
Down to earth, , but
JUST ME.....Issachar Humphrey! ^_^ </i></h4>
