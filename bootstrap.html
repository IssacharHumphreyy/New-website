	    <h4 style="background-color: Blue;">Bootstrapping or booting refers to a group of metaphors which refer to a self-sustaining process that proceeds without external help.
 
The phrase appears to have originated in the early 19th century United States (particularly in the sense "pull oneself over a fence by one's bootstraps"), to mean an absurdly impossible action, an adynaton.
 
Dr. Douglas Engelbart used the term centrally in his work from 1970 to 2010 referring to the process used by lumberjacks to hoist themselves up trees (to cut higher branches) using a strap wrapped around the tree. He founded an institute "The Bootstrap Alliance",[5] focused on "getting better at getting better" embodying the notion of the Bootstrap Circuit, taking in feedback from the output and feeding it back in to improve.</h3>
